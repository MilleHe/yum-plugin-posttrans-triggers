Post-transaction triggers for Yum

CHANGES WITH 1.3:
  * This is a minor release with an important bug fix.

  * There still were some cases where the plugin could crash when
    trying to get the file list of a package. The code is now much
    more robust and will simply ignore any package for which it can't
    obtain the file list.

  * Exceptions are now handled "the new way", to be more compatible
    with Python's expectations (especially Python 3 porting).

  * Some code was moved to be executed later, to avoid doing it if we
    are going to skip the package.

CHANGES WITH 1.2:
  * This is a minor release with only one fix for an important issue.

  * When the file list for a package can't be obtained from the RPM
    database, we now check the repositories metadata. A unit test was
    written to check this works.

  * Three unit tests were added to check updtes, obsoletions and
    removals.

  * Some refactoring happened in the unit tests, so that new ones are
    easier to write.

CHANGES WITH 1.1:
  * This is a minor release which only fixes some installation issues
    I uncovered when trying to package the 1.0 release.

  * The triggers folder now gets installed.

  * The code and configuration files now get installed with the
    appropriate modes.

INITIAL 1.0 RELEASE:
  * This is the very first release, considered stable and with the
    base feature set we wanted. See the README.rst file for more
    informations.
