Post-transaction triggers for Yum

CHANGES WITH 1.1:
  * This is a minor release which only fixes some installation issues
    I uncovered when trying to package the 1.0 release.

  * The triggers folder now gets installed.

  * The code and configuration files now get installed with the
    appropriate modes.

INITIAL 1.0 RELEASE:
  * This is the very first release, considered stable and with the
    base feature set we wanted. See the README.rst file for more
    informations.
