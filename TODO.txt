* path matching:
- Right now, [/usr/share/trucmuche] will match both /usr/share/trucmuche/foo
  and /usr/share/trucmuche-modules
  Do we want to enforce that the watched path be a real folder? Or is the
  current behavior what we want?

* triggers ordering
- Perhaps we could introduce a mechanism of priorities, to control the order
  in which triggers are executed?
