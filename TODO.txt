* de-duplication:
- perhaps compare the splitted commands instead of the strings?
  this would avoid "echo foo" being considered different from "echo  foo"
- enforce full path to executables?
  this would avoid "echo foo" being considered different from "/bin/echo foo"

* path matching:
- Right now, [/usr/share/trucmuche] will match both /usr/share/trucmuche/foo
  and /usr/share/trucmuche-modules
  Do we want to enforce that the watched path be a real folder? Or is the
  current behavior what we want?
